            This website uses an ML model to predict your personality. The dataset used for training the model can be

            The classification is done based on Multinomial Logistic Regression.

            Whenever a user takes up the test, the input is given to the ML model and the model predicts the
            personality trait of the user.

            <b>What is Support Vector Classifier (SVC)?</b> <br>
            A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
            It belongs to the family of Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
            SVC aims to find the best decision boundary (hyperplane) that separates different classes in the feature space.
            <br><br>
            This model is used to predict the probabilities of categorically dependent variable, which has two or more
            possible outcome classes. Whereas the logistic regression model is used when the dependent categorical
            variable has two outcome classes for example, students can either “Pass” or “Fail” in an exam or bank
            manager can either “Grant” or “Reject” the loan for a person.
